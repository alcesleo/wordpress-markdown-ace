# WordPress Markdown Ace

A plugin that turns the post editor into an instance of the [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about)
editor(the one used by Cloud9 and Github etc.) in Markdown mode.
This is meant to be used together with [Markdown On Save Improved](http://wordpress.org/plugins/markdown-on-save-improved/).

## Installation

This needs to be installed manually for now. Just clone this repo into your
`plugins`-folder and you should be good to go:

    cd /path/to/wordpress-site/wp-content/plugins/
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/alcesleo/wordpress-markdown-ace.git

# TODO:

- Get the `Add Media`-button to work
