# WordPress Markdown Ace

A plugin that turns the post editor into an instance of the [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about)
editor(the one used by Cloud9 and Github etc.) in Markdown mode.
This is meant to be used together with [Markdown On Save Improved](http://wordpress.org/plugins/markdown-on-save-improved/).
